# Task ID: 26
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations including code splitting, memoization, virtualized lists, and efficient rendering strategies.
# Details:
Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense. Add memoization for expensive calculations using useMemo and useCallback. Create virtualized lists for large datasets using react-window or react-virtualized. Implement efficient rendering strategies with shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo. Add bundle size optimization with tree shaking and code splitting. Create performance monitoring using React Profiler. Implement image and asset optimization. Add service worker for resource caching. Create loading strategies for optimal perceived performance.

# Test Strategy:
Measure load time improvements with code splitting. Test memoization effectiveness with performance benchmarks. Verify virtualized list performance with large datasets. Measure render performance with and without optimizations. Test bundle size reduction techniques. Use React Profiler to identify and fix performance bottlenecks. Verify image loading and optimization. Test service worker caching effectiveness. Measure perceived performance improvements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Application for Code Splitting Opportunities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify large modules and routes that can be split into separate bundles to reduce initial load time.
### Details:
Review the application's structure to find components, pages, or libraries that can be loaded asynchronously. Document potential split points for implementation.

## 2. Implement Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Apply dynamic imports and configure build tools (e.g., Webpack) to split code at identified points.
### Details:
Refactor code to use dynamic imports for heavy components and configure the bundler to generate separate chunks for each split point.

## 3. Identify Memoization Candidates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile the application to find expensive computations or components that re-render unnecessarily.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to detect performance bottlenecks and list functions or components that would benefit from memoization.

## 4. Apply Memoization Techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Implement memoization using appropriate libraries or built-in hooks (e.g., React.memo, useMemo).
### Details:
Refactor identified components and functions to use memoization, ensuring correctness and improved performance.

## 5. Integrate Virtualized Lists [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace large, scrollable lists with virtualized list components to render only visible items.
### Details:
Select a virtualization library (e.g., react-window, react-virtualized) and refactor list rendering logic to use it, minimizing DOM nodes.

## 6. Optimize Bundle Size and Minification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure build tools to minify and combine assets, reducing the number and size of HTTP requests.
### Details:
Enable minification and tree-shaking in the build pipeline, and ensure CSS/JS files are combined where appropriate to minimize requests and payload size.

## 7. Implement Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up tools to monitor runtime performance, bundle sizes, and user experience metrics.
### Details:
Integrate monitoring solutions (e.g., Google Lighthouse, Web Vitals, custom analytics) to track performance regressions and improvements.

## 8. Configure Service Worker Caching and Loading Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.6
### Description: Set up service workers to cache assets and implement advanced loading strategies (e.g., lazy loading, prefetching).
### Details:
Write and register service workers to cache static assets and API responses. Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources and prefetching for anticipated user actions.
