# Task ID: 22
# Title: Audit Logging and Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive audit logging for user actions and session management as specified in FR-SEC-001 and FR-SEC-004.
# Details:
Create authentication logging system for all login attempts. Implement user activity auditing for significant actions. Add session management interface for administrators. Create active session display with termination capabilities. Implement concurrent session limits per user. Add session timeout warnings and handling. Create audit log viewer with filtering and export. Implement tamper-resistant log storage. Add compliance reporting based on audit logs.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication logging for various scenarios. Verify user activity auditing for different actions. Test session management interface. Validate active session display and termination. Test concurrent session limits. Verify session timeout warnings and handling. Test audit log viewer with filtering and export. Ensure tamper-resistant properties of logs. Validate compliance reporting functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Authentication Log Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all authentication events to be logged and determine the required data fields for each event type
### Details:
Define comprehensive logging requirements for all authentication flows including login attempts, password changes, and account updates. Specify required fields such as user ID, timestamp, IP address, authentication method, and success/failure status.

## 2. Implement Structured Authentication Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Create a standardized, easily parsable logging format for all authentication events
### Details:
Implement JSON-structured logging for authentication events with consistent field naming. Ensure logs capture all required information including contextual data (IP, device, location) and transform raw log entries into structured format for efficient analysis.

## 3. Develop Session Management Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Create backend services to track and manage user sessions
### Details:
Implement backend services for session creation, validation, and termination. Include functionality for session timeout configuration, concurrent session tracking, and session metadata storage with appropriate database schema design.

## 4. Build Session Management UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Create user interface components for displaying and managing active sessions
### Details:
Develop UI components showing current session information, session history, and controls for session termination. Include responsive design for different device types and accessibility compliance.

## 5. Implement Concurrent Session Limits [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Add functionality to enforce and manage maximum concurrent session limits
### Details:
Develop configurable concurrent session limits with policy enforcement. Include user notification for session termination, priority rules for which sessions to maintain, and admin override capabilities.

## 6. Create Tamper-Resistant Log Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Implement secure, tamper-resistant storage for authentication and audit logs
### Details:
Design and implement cryptographically secure log storage with integrity verification. Include log rotation policies, encryption at rest, access controls, and backup procedures that maintain the chain of custody for logs.

## 7. Develop Audit Log Viewer Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.6
### Description: Create a user interface for searching, filtering, and reviewing audit logs
### Details:
Build an advanced log viewer with search capabilities, filtering options, and visualization tools. Include export functionality, role-based access controls, and anomaly highlighting for security events.

## 8. Implement Compliance Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.6, 22.7
### Description: Create automated compliance reports based on authentication and session data
### Details:
Develop a reporting system that generates compliance documentation for standards like SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA. Include scheduled report generation, customizable templates, and evidence collection automation for audit preparation.
