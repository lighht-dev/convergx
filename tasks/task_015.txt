# Task ID: 15
# Title: Coverage Mapping Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the interactive coverage mapping interface with signal strength visualization and gap analysis as specified in FR-COV-001 through FR-COV-004.
# Details:
Integrate Mapbox or Leaflet for interactive map functionality. Implement color-coded overlays for signal strength visualization. Create heatmap visualizations for coverage density. Add map filtering and layer controls for network technologies and frequency bands. Implement coverage gap analysis with visual highlighting. Add device location mapping if specified as an enhancement. Create map export and sharing functionality. Implement zoom and pan controls for detailed regional analysis. Add location-based filtering for devices and metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Test map rendering with different coverage data. Verify color-coded overlays and heatmaps. Test filtering and layer controls. Validate coverage gap analysis. Test device location mapping if implemented. Verify map export functionality. Test zoom and pan controls. Ensure map performance with large datasets. Validate location-based filtering.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Map Integration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the chosen mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps, Mapbox) into the application and ensure the map renders correctly within the UI framework.
### Details:
Install required dependencies, configure API keys, and render a basic map component as the foundation for further features.

## 2. Implement Overlay Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Enable the display of various overlays (e.g., polygons, markers, custom shapes) on the map to represent different data layers.
### Details:
Design overlay data structures, implement rendering logic for each overlay type, and ensure overlays can be toggled on/off.

## 3. Develop Heatmap Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Add heatmap layer functionality to visualize data density or intensity across geographic regions.
### Details:
Integrate heatmap rendering, configure color gradients, and optimize performance for large datasets.

## 4. Build Filtering and Layer Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Create UI controls for filtering data and toggling map layers, including overlays and heatmaps.
### Details:
Design and implement filter logic, connect controls to map layers, and ensure real-time updates based on user input.

## 5. Conduct Gap Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Analyze current map features versus requirements to identify missing functionalities or data gaps.
### Details:
Document gaps, prioritize missing features, and provide recommendations for addressing deficiencies.

## 6. Device Mapping Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.4
### Description: Map device locations and statuses onto the map, supporting real-time updates and device-specific overlays.
### Details:
Integrate device data sources, render device markers, and implement status-based iconography or clustering.

## 7. Export and Sharing Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.6
### Description: Enable users to export map views (e.g., as images, PDFs, or data files) and share map states via links or embeds.
### Details:
Implement export logic, generate shareable URLs, and ensure exported content reflects current map state and filters.

## 8. Implement Zoom, Pan, and Location-Based Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.4
### Description: Add interactive zoom and pan controls, and enable filtering of map data based on the current viewport or user-selected locations.
### Details:
Ensure smooth map navigation, update visible data dynamically based on viewport, and support location-based queries.
