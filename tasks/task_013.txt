# Task ID: 13
# Title: Session History and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop session history and analytics interfaces with filtering, statistics, and pattern analysis as specified in FR-SESS-001 and FR-SESS-002.
# Details:
Create session management interface with filterable historical data. Implement session analytics and statistics visualizations. Add session pattern analysis components. Create session duration analysis charts. Implement SIM association details display. Add RAN utilization and Core network routing information. Create session export functionality. Implement session filtering by time period, device type, and RAN. Add peak usage identification and visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Test session history display with large datasets. Verify filtering functionality for session data. Test analytics visualizations for accuracy. Validate pattern analysis components. Test export functionality. Verify SIM association details. Test RAN utilization and Core network information display. Ensure all visualizations render correctly on different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Session Management UI Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core UI framework for session management that will house all analytics components
