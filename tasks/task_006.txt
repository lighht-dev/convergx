# Task ID: 6
# Title: State Management Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Redux Toolkit for global state management, including store configuration, slices for different data domains, and middleware for side effects.
# Details:
Configure Redux store with Redux Toolkit. Create state slices for different domains (devices, SIMs, events, user preferences, etc.). Implement Redux middleware for side effects using Redux Thunk or Redux Saga. Set up selectors for efficient state access. Add Redux DevTools integration for development. Implement state persistence for user preferences using localStorage. Create action creators for all state modifications. Add normalization for relational data to optimize state updates. Implement optimistic updates for better user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Test Redux store initialization. Verify all reducers handle their actions correctly. Test selectors return expected data. Validate middleware functions correctly for async operations. Test state persistence across page reloads. Verify optimistic updates work as expected. Test performance with large state objects. Ensure DevTools integration works in development mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Redux store with Redux Toolkit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the Redux store using Redux Toolkit's configureStore function with proper structure and organization
### Details:
Import necessary modules from Redux Toolkit, create a store configuration object with rootReducer, and set up the Provider component to make the store available throughout the application. Follow the recommended pattern of using configureStore instead of createStore for better defaults.

## 2. Create domain slices using feature folders [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Structure Redux code using feature folders with single-file logic for each domain slice
### Details:
Organize state based on data types rather than components. Create separate slices for different data domains (e.g., users, posts) using createSlice from Redux Toolkit. Name state slices based on stored data, not reducers (e.g., {users: {}, posts: {}} rather than {usersReducer: {}, postsReducer: {}}).

## 3. Implement middleware integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Add and configure necessary middleware for the Redux store
### Details:
Configure middleware through the middleware option in configureStore. Include standard middleware like thunk for async operations, and custom middleware as needed. Ensure middleware is properly ordered for correct execution flow.

## 4. Create memoized selectors for derived data [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement selector functions to derive additional values from minimal state
### Details:
Keep actual data in Redux store minimal and derive additional values using selector functions. Use libraries like reselect or proxy-memoize to create memoized selectors for performance optimization. Create selectors for filtered lists, calculated totals, and other derived data.

## 5. Set up Redux DevTools for debugging [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Configure Redux DevTools for development environment
### Details:
Enable Redux DevTools through the devTools option in configureStore. Set it conditionally based on environment (e.g., devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'). Test that time-travel debugging and state inspection are working properly.

## 6. Implement state persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Add functionality to persist and rehydrate Redux state
### Details:
Integrate redux-persist or a similar library to save state to localStorage or other storage mechanisms. Configure persistence options including storage engine, whitelist/blacklist of slices to persist, and rehydration strategy. Handle migration of persisted state between app versions.

## 7. Implement data normalization for complex state [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Normalize complex nested or relational data in the Redux store
### Details:
Store complex data in a normalized form using a flat structure with IDs as references between entities. Use createEntityAdapter from Redux Toolkit for common CRUD operations on normalized data. Implement proper normalization for API responses before storing in Redux.

## 8. Add optimistic updates for better UX [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.7
### Description: Implement optimistic updates for user actions to improve perceived performance
### Details:
Create action creators and reducers that update the UI immediately before API calls complete. Implement rollback mechanisms in case of API failures. Use middleware to handle the actual API calls and dispatch success/failure actions accordingly.
