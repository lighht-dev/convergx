# Task ID: 10
# Title: Device Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the device management interface with grid display, detailed views, and configuration management as specified in FR-DEV-001 through FR-DEV-004.
# Details:
Create responsive device grid layout with informative tiles. Implement device tile components with status indicators, signal strength meters, and traffic throughput. Add detailed device view pages with comprehensive information tabs. Implement device configuration management interface. Create AI-generated device status analysis component. Add device filtering and sorting capabilities. Implement device search functionality. Create device export and reporting features. Add device type-appropriate icons and visual indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test device grid layout on different screen sizes. Verify device tile information accuracy. Test detailed device view with all required information tabs. Validate configuration management interface. Test AI-generated status analysis. Verify filtering, sorting, and search functionality. Test device export and reporting. Ensure real-time updates of device status indicators.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Responsive Device Grid Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible 8px grid system for the device management interface that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy
### Details:
Use Material Design responsive layout principles to ensure consistency across devices. Place elements inside column sets and avoid using columns as padding. Implement breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## 2. Develop Tile Component Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Design and implement reusable tile components that display device information consistently within the grid system
### Details:
Create a component library with standardized tiles that maintain proper alignment and spacing. Ensure tiles can expand/collapse and display different data types while adhering to the 8px grid system.

## 3. Create Detailed Device View Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop an expandable detailed view that presents comprehensive device information when a tile is selected
### Details:
Design a modal or side panel that maintains grid alignment while displaying detailed device metrics, status, and configuration options. Implement smooth transitions between tile and detailed views.

## 4. Build Configuration Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement interfaces for viewing and modifying device configurations within the grid-based layout
### Details:
Create forms and controls for configuration settings that maintain visual consistency. Develop validation logic and implement save/cancel functionality that provides clear feedback within the grid system.

## 5. Develop AI Status Analysis Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create visualization components for AI-powered device status analysis that fit within the responsive grid
### Details:
Design charts, graphs and status indicators that display AI insights while maintaining grid alignment. Implement real-time updates that don't disrupt the visual hierarchy of the interface.

## 6. Implement Filtering and Sorting Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create UI controls for filtering and sorting devices within the grid layout
### Details:
Design filter panels and sorting controls that integrate with the grid system. Ensure the grid maintains proper alignment when the visible device set changes through filtering or sorting operations.

## 7. Build Search Interface and Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.6
### Description: Develop a search system that allows users to quickly find specific devices within the grid
### Details:
Create a search input that follows grid alignment principles. Implement search results display that highlights matching devices while maintaining the overall grid structure and visual hierarchy.

## 8. Create Export and Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Develop functionality for exporting device data and generating reports with consistent visual styling
### Details:
Design export controls and report templates that follow the same grid principles as the main interface. Implement PDF and spreadsheet export options that preserve data relationships and visual organization.
