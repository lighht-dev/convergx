# Task ID: 20
# Title: Local Storage Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement local storage for UI state, authentication tokens, and offline data caching as specified in FR-LOC-001 through FR-LOC-003.
# Details:
Create local storage service for persistent data management. Implement UI state persistence for last viewed sections and filter preferences. Add secure storage for authentication tokens using appropriate browser mechanisms. Create offline data caching system for recent events and device status. Implement storage quota management to prevent exceeding browser limits. Add data synchronization for offline changes. Create storage cleanup routines for outdated data. Implement encryption for sensitive stored data. Add storage migration for version updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI state persistence across sessions. Verify secure token storage. Test offline data caching with network disconnection. Validate storage quota management. Test data synchronization after offline period. Verify storage cleanup works correctly. Ensure encryption for sensitive data. Test storage migration with version changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Local Storage Service Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and API for the local storage service, including methods for CRUD operations, namespacing, and error handling.
### Details:
Specify interfaces for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Plan for extensibility to support future features like encryption and migration.

## 2. Implement UI State Persistence Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop a system to persist and restore UI state using local storage, ensuring seamless user experience across sessions.
### Details:
Identify UI state elements to persist (e.g., theme, layout, form data). Implement serialization and deserialization logic, and integrate with the local storage service.

## 3. Develop Secure Token Storage Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create a secure method for storing authentication tokens and sensitive data in local storage, minimizing security risks.
### Details:
Implement token storage with obfuscation or encryption. Ensure tokens are only accessible by authorized code and consider using secure cookies or session storage for highly sensitive data.

## 4. Build Offline Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement offline caching to allow data access and modification when the user is disconnected, with synchronization upon reconnection.
### Details:
Design cache invalidation strategies, handle conflict resolution, and queue changes for later synchronization.

## 5. Implement Quota Management and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Monitor and manage local storage usage, handling quota limits gracefully and providing user feedback when limits are approached or exceeded.
### Details:
Detect storage quota, track usage, and implement strategies for freeing space or warning users. Handle storage exceptions and fallback scenarios.

## 6. Develop Data Synchronization and Migration Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.4
### Description: Create routines for synchronizing local data with remote sources and migrating data structures across application versions.
### Details:
Implement sync logic for two-way data updates, resolve conflicts, and provide migration scripts for schema changes or upgrades.

## 7. Integrate Encryption and Cleanup Routines [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.3
### Description: Add encryption for sensitive data at rest and implement automated cleanup routines to remove stale or obsolete data.
### Details:
Choose and integrate a client-side encryption library, manage encryption keys securely, and schedule regular cleanup based on data age or usage patterns.
