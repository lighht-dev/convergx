# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication and User Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure authentication system with JWT token handling, user session management, and role-based access control as specified in ST-101, ST-102, and ST-103.
# Details:
Create login page with form validation. Implement JWT token-based authentication with secure storage in browser. Add token refresh mechanism to handle expiration. Create authentication context provider to manage user state throughout the application. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system with permission checks for UI elements and API calls. Add session timeout handling with automatic logout and warning notifications. Implement secure token storage using appropriate browser mechanisms. Create protected route components that check authentication and permissions. Add login audit logging for security compliance as specified in FR-SEC-001.

# Test Strategy:
Test login with valid and invalid credentials. Verify token refresh works correctly. Test role-based access restrictions for different user types. Validate session timeout and warning notifications. Ensure authentication persists across page refreshes. Test concurrent session handling. Verify audit logging captures all authentication events correctly.
