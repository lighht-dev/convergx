# Task ID: 12
# Title: Performance Monitoring Dashboards
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance monitoring dashboards with real-time KPIs, metric visualizations, and historical trend analysis as specified in FR-PERF-001 through FR-PERF-007.
# Details:
Create real-time KPI dashboard with gauges and trend charts. Implement metric visualization views for bandwidth, device counts, error rates, etc. Add temporal data controls for switching between time ranges. Implement data export capabilities for metrics. Create historical trend analysis views with advanced filtering. Add performance threshold management with visual highlighting. Implement site-based filtering for metrics. Create chart components using Recharts and D3.js for different visualization types. Add AI-generated performance insights component.

# Test Strategy:
Test KPI dashboard with real-time updates. Verify metric visualizations display correctly. Test temporal data controls for different time ranges. Validate data export functionality. Test historical trend analysis with large datasets. Verify threshold highlighting works correctly. Test site-based filtering. Ensure charts render correctly on different screen sizes. Validate AI-generated insights.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Establish Real-Time Data Ingestion Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a streaming data pipeline to capture, process, and deliver real-time data from multiple sources for the dashboard.
### Details:
Set up connectors for databases, APIs, and IoT devices. Ensure low-latency data flow and handle schema evolution. Integrate change data capture (CDC) where necessary.

## 2. Develop Metric Calculation and Aggregation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Build a backend service to compute, aggregate, and store KPI metrics in real time for visualization and analysis.
### Details:
Implement logic for calculating KPIs, handling historical and streaming data, and supporting custom metric definitions. Optimize for performance and scalability.

## 3. Design and Implement Metric Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create reusable, interactive chart and visualization components for displaying KPIs, trends, and comparisons.
### Details:
Develop components such as line charts, bar charts, gauges, and heatmaps. Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and support for real-time updates.

## 4. Integrate Temporal Controls and Time Range Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Enable users to filter and analyze data across custom time ranges and intervals within the dashboard.
### Details:
Implement date pickers, quick range selectors (e.g., last 24h, 7d, 30d), and support for time zone adjustments. Ensure backend queries respect selected timeframes.

## 5. Implement Data Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Allow users to export dashboard data and visualizations in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF, image).
### Details:
Support exporting raw data, aggregated metrics, and chart snapshots. Ensure exports reflect current filters and selections.

## 6. Develop Trend Analysis and Historical Comparison Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Provide users with tools to analyze trends, compare periods, and identify patterns in KPI data.
### Details:
Implement features like period-over-period comparison, moving averages, and anomaly detection. Visualize trends with overlays and summary statistics.

## 7. Build Threshold and Alert Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Enable users to set thresholds for KPIs and receive alerts when values cross defined limits.
### Details:
Allow configuration of static and dynamic thresholds, notification preferences (email, SMS, in-app), and alert history tracking.

## 8. Implement Site-Based Filtering and Segmentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Allow users to filter and segment dashboard data by site, region, or other organizational units.
### Details:
Support multi-site selection, drill-downs, and aggregation by site. Ensure all visualizations and exports respect active filters.

## 9. Integrate AI-Driven Insights and Recommendations [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.6
### Description: Leverage AI/ML to surface actionable insights, detect anomalies, and provide recommendations based on KPI data.
### Details:
Implement models for trend prediction, anomaly detection, and automated commentary. Display insights contextually within the dashboard.
