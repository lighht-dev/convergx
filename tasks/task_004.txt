# Task ID: 4
# Title: API Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the API integration layer to connect with backend services using REST and GraphQL, including error handling, request/response transformation, and authentication as specified in FR-SYS-001.
# Details:
Create API client service using Axios for REST endpoints. Configure request interceptors for authentication token injection. Implement response interceptors for error handling and response transformation. Set up Apollo Client for GraphQL integration. Create API service modules for different resource types (devices, SIMs, events, etc.). Implement retry logic for failed requests. Add request caching for performance optimization. Create mock API responses for development and testing as specified in FR-SYS-004. Implement API error boundary components for graceful UI error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test API calls with authentication. Verify error handling for different error types (network, authentication, server). Test retry mechanism for transient failures. Validate request/response interceptors function correctly. Ensure mock API responses work in development mode. Test cache invalidation logic. Verify GraphQL queries return expected data structures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up REST client base configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a base REST client with axios or fetch that will handle common configuration settings
### Details:
Implement a base client that configures base URL, default headers, timeout settings, and request/response transformations. Follow REST best practices for consistent API interactions.

## 2. Implement authentication interceptors [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create interceptors to handle authentication tokens and refresh logic
### Details:
Build request interceptors that automatically add authentication headers, and response interceptors that handle token expiration. Implement token refresh logic that retries failed requests after obtaining a new token.

## 3. Develop comprehensive error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a centralized error handling system for API requests
### Details:
Implement error categorization (network, server, validation), standardized error response formatting, and logging mechanisms. Create utility functions for parsing different error types and presenting user-friendly messages.

## 4. Set up GraphQL client integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Apollo Client or similar GraphQL client with the application
### Details:
Configure a GraphQL client with schema definition language support, proper caching strategies, and query optimization. Follow GraphQL best practices to query only the data needed where it's needed.

## 5. Create resource-specific API modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.4
### Description: Develop modular API services for different resource types
### Details:
Create separate modules for each resource type (users, products, etc.) with appropriate REST endpoints and GraphQL queries/mutations. Implement consistent interfaces across modules regardless of the underlying protocol.

## 6. Implement retry logic and request cancellation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.4
### Description: Add retry mechanisms for failed requests and request cancellation capabilities
### Details:
Build configurable retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures. Implement request cancellation for long-running requests when components unmount or user navigates away.

## 7. Develop caching strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.4
### Description: Implement client-side caching for both REST and GraphQL responses
### Details:
Configure appropriate cache policies, TTL settings, and cache invalidation strategies. For GraphQL, leverage Apollo's normalized cache. For REST, implement a custom caching layer with proper cache headers support.

## 8. Create mock API and error boundary components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Develop mock API responses for testing and error boundary components for graceful failure handling
### Details:
Build a mock API system that simulates both REST and GraphQL responses for development and testing. Create reusable error boundary components that catch API errors and display appropriate fallback UIs.
