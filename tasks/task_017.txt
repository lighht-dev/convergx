# Task ID: 17
# Title: Command and Automation Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement command execution, status tracking, and automation interfaces as specified in FR-CMD-001, FR-CMD-002, and ST-123.
# Details:
Create command execution interface for diagnostic and configuration tasks. Implement command re-execution capability from historical events. Add command status tracking with real-time updates. Create command result logging and display. Implement bulk operation support for multiple devices. Add command template management for standardized procedures. Create automated task scheduling. Implement command history and audit logging. Add command authorization checks based on user roles.

# Test Strategy:
Test command execution with different command types. Verify re-execution from historical events. Test status tracking with real-time updates. Validate result logging and display. Test bulk operations with multiple devices. Verify template management. Test automated scheduling. Ensure command history and audit logging works correctly. Validate authorization checks for different user roles.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Command Execution UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user-friendly interface for command execution with clear feedback mechanisms
### Details:
Implement a command execution UI that follows established conventions, uses descriptive verbs and adjectives for commands, avoids vague or generic command names, and includes ellipses to indicate when more information is required. Ensure each action has a clear reaction to indicate system status.

## 2. Implement Command Re-execution Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a system for users to easily re-run previous commands
### Details:
Create a command history feature that allows users to select and re-execute previous commands. Include options to modify parameters before re-execution and provide clear feedback when a command is being re-run versus executed for the first time.

## 3. Build Real-time Status Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create visual indicators for command progress and status updates
### Details:
Implement progress displays that keep users informed about ongoing processes. Include visual indicators such as progress bars, spinners, or status messages that update in real-time. Ensure users can easily understand the current state of command execution.

## 4. Develop Result Logging Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3
### Description: Create a system to capture and display command execution results
### Details:
Build a logging system that captures command outputs, errors, and execution details. Design a user interface to display these logs in a readable format with options for filtering, searching, and exporting log data.

## 5. Implement Bulk Operations Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Create functionality for executing multiple commands as a batch
### Details:
Develop a system for defining, validating, and executing multiple commands as a single operation. Include features for error handling, partial execution, and rollback capabilities. Provide clear progress indicators for the overall batch and individual commands.

## 6. Create Template Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Build functionality for saving, editing, and applying command templates
### Details:
Implement a template system allowing users to save command configurations as reusable templates. Include features for template creation, editing, categorization, and application. Ensure templates follow consistent naming conventions and provide clear documentation.

## 7. Develop Command Scheduling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Build a system for scheduling commands to run at specific times
### Details:
Create a scheduling system that allows users to define when commands should execute. Include options for one-time and recurring schedules, timezone handling, conflict resolution, and notifications. Provide a clear interface for managing scheduled commands.

## 8. Implement Authorization and Audit System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.4, 17.7
### Description: Create security controls and comprehensive logging for command execution
### Details:
Develop a system for authorization checks before command execution and detailed audit logging of all command activities. Include user authentication, permission management, and secure storage of sensitive command parameters. Ensure audit logs capture who executed what command, when, and with what result.
