# Task ID: 5
# Title: Real-time Data Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection for real-time updates of network metrics, device status, and events as specified in FR-SYS-002.
# Details:
Set up WebSocket client using Socket.io or native WebSocket API. Implement connection management with automatic reconnection logic. Create message handlers for different event types. Implement store integration to update Redux state with real-time data. Add connection status indicators in UI. Create fallback mechanism for environments where WebSockets are not available. Implement message queuing for offline operation. Add throttling for high-frequency updates to prevent UI performance issues. Ensure real-time updates meet the sub-5-second latency requirement.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connection establishment and reconnection. Verify real-time updates appear in UI within 5 seconds. Test behavior during connection loss and recovery. Measure performance under high message volume. Validate fallback mechanisms when WebSockets are unavailable. Test message queuing during offline operation. Verify correct handling of different message types.

# Subtasks:
## 1. WebSocket/SSE Client Library Selection and Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and initialize the appropriate client library for WebSocket and/or SSE based on application requirements and browser compatibility.
### Details:
Evaluate available libraries for both WebSocket and SSE, considering factors such as bidirectional vs unidirectional communication, ease of integration, and fallback support. Set up the initial client connection logic.

## 2. Connection Management and Reconnection Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement robust connection management, including automatic reconnection strategies and handling of connection drops for both WebSocket and SSE.
### Details:
Design logic to detect connection loss, trigger reconnection attempts, and manage exponential backoff or retry intervals. For SSE, leverage built-in reconnection and handle missed events using event IDs. For WebSocket, implement custom reconnection and state restoration.

## 3. Message Handler Registration and Dispatch [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a modular system for registering and dispatching message handlers based on message types or channels.
### Details:
Create a registry for message handlers, allowing dynamic addition and removal. Ensure incoming messages are parsed and dispatched to the correct handler functions efficiently.

## 4. Redux Integration for Real-Time State Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Integrate WebSocket/SSE message flows with Redux to ensure real-time updates are reflected in the application state.
### Details:
Design Redux actions and reducers to process incoming messages. Ensure middleware or side effects (e.g., redux-saga, redux-thunk) are used for asynchronous message handling and state synchronization.

## 5. UI Indicators for Connection and Message Status [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Implement UI components to display connection status, message activity, and error states to users.
### Details:
Design and build visual indicators (e.g., status bars, spinners, banners) that reflect real-time connection health, message receipt, and error conditions. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

## 6. Fallback Mechanisms for Unsupported Browsers or Failures [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop fallback strategies such as long polling or alternate transports for environments where WebSocket/SSE is unavailable or fails.
### Details:
Detect browser capabilities and gracefully degrade to supported alternatives. Implement logic to switch between transports without data loss or user disruption.

## 7. Message Queuing and Delivery Guarantees [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement client-side message queuing to ensure reliable delivery and processing, especially during connection interruptions.
### Details:
Queue outgoing messages when offline and flush them upon reconnection. For SSE, handle missed events using event IDs and server-side event replay. For WebSocket, ensure messages are not lost during reconnects.

## 8. Throttling and Rate Limiting of Incoming and Outgoing Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.7
### Description: Design and implement throttling mechanisms to prevent message floods and ensure optimal performance.
### Details:
Apply rate limiting to both incoming and outgoing message streams. Use debouncing, batching, or token bucket algorithms as appropriate. Monitor and log throttling events for diagnostics.
