# Task ID: 23
# Title: Data Visualization Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop reusable data visualization components for charts, graphs, and network topology using Recharts and D3.js.
# Details:
Create line chart components for trend visualization. Implement gauge components for current value display. Add bar chart components for comparative analysis. Create heatmap components for correlation visualization. Implement network topology diagram using D3.js. Add time series chart components with zoom capabilities. Create pie and donut charts for distribution analysis. Implement radar charts for multi-dimensional data. Add export capabilities for all chart types. Create responsive chart containers that adapt to different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test all chart components with various data sets. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Test interactive features like tooltips and zooming. Validate export functionality for different formats. Test network topology diagram with various network structures. Ensure accessibility compliance for all visualization components. Test performance with large datasets. Verify correct rendering across supported browsers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Line Chart Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a reusable line chart component with configurable axes, data points, and styling options
### Details:
Develop a line chart component using presentational and container pattern. Include features for customizable axes labels, multiple data series support, tooltip integration, and zoom/pan capabilities. Implement proper TypeScript typing for all props and events.

## 2. Build Gauge Component System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a flexible gauge visualization with customizable ranges, thresholds, and animations
### Details:
Create both circular and linear gauge variants with configurable min/max values, color ranges, and threshold indicators. Implement smooth animations for value changes and ensure the component supports both static and real-time data updates through two-way binding.

## 3. Develop Bar Chart Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create horizontal and vertical bar chart components with grouping and stacking capabilities
### Details:
Build bar chart components supporting horizontal/vertical orientations, grouped/stacked configurations, and customizable bar styling. Include features for sorting, filtering, and interactive highlighting. Implement proper event handling for click and hover interactions.

## 4. Implement Heatmap Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a configurable heatmap component with customizable color scales and cell interactions
### Details:
Develop a heatmap component with support for different color scales, cell sizes, and labeling options. Include features for legend generation, tooltip information, and cell highlighting. Ensure the component handles sparse data and different grid configurations efficiently.

## 5. Build Topology Diagram System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create components for visualizing network topologies with nodes, edges, and interactive behaviors
### Details:
Implement a topology visualization system with customizable node and edge rendering, layout algorithms, and interactive capabilities. Support features like zooming, panning, node selection, and path highlighting. Ensure the system can handle both static and dynamic topology updates.

## 6. Develop Time Series Chart Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Create specialized charts for time-based data with range selection and aggregation features
### Details:
Build on the line chart foundation to create time series specific components with date/time axis formatting, time range selection, data aggregation options, and anomaly highlighting. Implement efficient data handling for large time series datasets and support for real-time updates.

## 7. Implement Circular Chart Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create pie, donut, and radar chart components with consistent APIs and interaction patterns
### Details:
Develop circular visualization components including pie, donut, and radar charts with consistent prop interfaces. Include features for segment highlighting, legend integration, and animation effects. Ensure proper accessibility support with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

## 8. Create Responsive Container and Export System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6, 23.7
### Description: Implement a responsive container component and export functionality for all visualization types
### Details:
Develop a responsive container HOC that adapts visualizations to different screen sizes and devices. Implement export functionality supporting image (PNG, SVG) and data (CSV, JSON) formats. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across all visualization components when resizing or exporting.
