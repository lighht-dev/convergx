# Task ID: 9
# Title: SIM Card Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the SIM card management interface with listing, filtering, and detailed views as specified in FR-SIM-001 through FR-SIM-006.
# Details:
Create SIM card listing page with searchable and sortable table. Implement detailed SIM card view with all specified information (activation status, last session details, ICCID, IMEI, etc.). Add advanced filtering system for SIM cards based on multiple criteria. Implement SIM provisioning workflow for adding new SIMs. Create deactivated SIM management interface. Add APN and tag configuration capabilities. Implement SIM activity history display with comprehensive logging. Create bulk import functionality for SIM cards. Add export capabilities for SIM data.

# Test Strategy:
Test SIM listing with large datasets. Verify search and filter functionality. Test SIM detail view displays all required information. Validate provisioning workflow for new SIMs. Test bulk import and export functionality. Verify activity history logging and display. Test APN and tag configuration. Ensure all SIM management functions respect user permissions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SIM Card Listing View [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive view to display all SIM cards with essential information including ICCID, connection status, and associated device details
### Details:
Develop a paginated table view with sorting capabilities. Include visual indicators for connection status (active/inactive). Display key metrics like data usage and last connection time. Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.

## 2. Create SIM Card Detail View [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1

### Details:
Build APN configuration form with validation. Implement tag creation, assignment, and management. Create bulk tag assignment functionality. Add APN templates for quick configuration. Include network operator-specific APN presets.

## 7. Implement Activity History Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive activity log system to track all changes and events related to SIM cards
### Details:
Design activity log database schema. Implement logging for all SIM operations (activation, deactivation, configuration changes). Create filterable activity timeline view. Add export functionality for logs. Implement retention policies for historical data.

## 8. Develop Bulk Import/Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Build tools for importing and exporting SIM data in bulk, supporting various file formats and validation
