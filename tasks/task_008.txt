# Task ID: 8
# Title: Dashboard Overview Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main dashboard overview with customizable widgets, KPI displays, and network status summaries as specified in FR-PERF-001.
# Details:
Implement dashboard grid layout with customizable widget positioning. Create widget components for different data types (KPIs, charts, status indicators, etc.). Add drag-and-drop functionality for widget arrangement. Implement widget settings and customization options. Create AI-generated network health summary component. Implement real-time performance indicators for throughput and device connectivity. Create interactive network topology diagram component. Add dashboard state persistence using localStorage. Implement dashboard export and sharing functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard layout on different screen sizes. Verify widget customization and persistence. Test drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging widgets. Validate real-time updates in dashboard components. Test AI summary generation and display. Verify network topology diagram interaction. Test dashboard state restoration after page reload. Ensure accessibility compliance for all dashboard components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dashboard Grid Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive grid layout system that supports 12-column structure with customizable gutters and offsets
### Details:
Develop a flexible grid system that allows widgets to be placed in various column configurations. Support both stratified layouts (hierarchical information flow) and grouped layouts (related widgets visually clustered). Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes.

## 2. Develop Core Widget Component Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design and implement the base widget component structure with inheritance patterns for specialized widget types
### Details:
Create a widget base class with common properties (size, position, title, refresh rate). Implement specialized widget types (charts, metrics, tables) that inherit from the base. Ensure each widget has proper lifecycle hooks and rendering optimization.

## 3. Implement Drag-and-Drop Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a drag-and-drop system for widget placement and rearrangement within the dashboard grid
### Details:
Implement mouse/touch event handlers for dragging widgets. Add visual indicators for valid drop zones based on grid layout. Create snap-to-grid functionality for precise placement. Include collision detection to prevent widget overlap.

## 4. Build Widget Customization Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a configuration panel for customizing widget appearance, data sources, and visualization options
### Details:
Create a modal or sidebar interface for widget settings. Implement form controls for changing widget properties (colors, sizes, data refresh rates). Add preview functionality to see changes before applying them.

## 5. Integrate AI Summary Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement AI-powered data analysis to generate automatic insights and summaries from dashboard data
### Details:
Connect to AI service API for data analysis. Create data transformation layer to prepare dashboard data for AI processing. Design summary widget to display AI-generated insights with appropriate visualizations.

## 6. Develop Real-time Data Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a system for real-time data updates and visual indicators showing data freshness and changes
### Details:
Implement WebSocket or polling mechanism for real-time data updates. Add visual indicators for data freshness (timestamps, loading spinners). Create animations for data changes to highlight updates. Optimize for performance with throttling and debouncing.

## 7. Implement Interactive Topology Diagram Widget [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Build a specialized widget for displaying and interacting with network/system topology diagrams
### Details:
Create a canvas-based rendering system for topology elements. Implement zoom, pan, and selection interactions. Add support for different node and connection types. Include automatic layout algorithms for optimal diagram arrangement.

## 8. Build Dashboard State Persistence System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement functionality to save, load, and restore dashboard configurations and states
### Details:
Design data structure for serializing dashboard state (widget positions, types, settings). Create backend API endpoints for saving/loading configurations. Implement auto-save functionality with version history. Add user preferences storage.

## 9. Develop Export and Sharing Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.8
### Description: Create functionality for exporting dashboard data and sharing configurations with other users
### Details:
Implement PDF/image export of dashboard views. Add data export options (CSV, JSON). Create shareable dashboard links with configurable permissions. Develop collaboration features for multiple users working on the same dashboard.
