# Task ID: 21
# Title: Role-Based Access Control Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive RBAC system with user management, permission assignment, and access control as specified in ST-102.
# Details:
Create user management interface for administrators. Implement role definition and assignment system. Add granular permission configuration for different features. Create permission-based UI rendering to hide unauthorized elements. Implement API access control based on permissions. Add role hierarchy support for permission inheritance. Create permission audit logging. Implement temporary permission elevation for specific tasks. Add permission templates for common role types.

# Test Strategy:
Test user management interface. Verify role assignment functionality. Test permission configuration for different features. Validate permission-based UI rendering. Test API access control with different permissions. Verify role hierarchy and permission inheritance. Test permission audit logging. Ensure temporary permission elevation works correctly. Validate permission templates for common roles.
