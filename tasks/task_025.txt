# Task ID: 25
# Title: Error Handling and Fallback UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, fallback UI components, and offline capabilities.
# Details:
Create error boundary components for graceful failure handling. Implement fallback UI for network errors. Add offline mode indicators and functionality. Create error notification system with appropriate messaging. Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations. Add data recovery options after errors. Create diagnostic information collection for troubleshooting. Implement graceful degradation for feature unavailability. Add error logging and reporting to backend services.

# Test Strategy:
Test error boundaries with simulated component failures. Verify fallback UI for various error scenarios. Test offline mode functionality with network disconnection. Validate error notifications with different error types. Test retry mechanisms for failed operations. Verify data recovery after errors. Ensure diagnostic information is collected correctly. Test graceful degradation of features. Validate error logging and reporting to backend.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and integrate error boundary components to catch JavaScript errors in the component tree, log them, and prevent the entire app from crashing.
### Details:
Develop reusable error boundary components using React's componentDidCatch lifecycle or equivalent. Strategically place them at component, layout, and route levels to isolate failures and improve resilience. Ensure error boundaries are tested for various error scenarios.

## 2. Design and Display Fallback UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop user-friendly fallback UIs that are shown when an error is caught by an error boundary.
### Details:
Create clear, concise fallback messages that avoid technical jargon. Ensure fallback UIs guide users on next steps and maintain brand consistency. Allow for customization based on error context.

## 3. Implement Offline Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Detect and display the application's offline status to users, ensuring they are aware of connectivity issues.
### Details:
Use browser APIs or service workers to monitor network status. Show prominent indicators when offline, and update UI dynamically when connectivity is restored.

## 4. Develop Error Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Notify users of errors through non-intrusive notifications, providing context and possible actions.
### Details:
Integrate toast or modal notifications for errors not handled by fallback UI. Ensure notifications are accessible, dismissible, and provide actionable information where possible.

## 5. Implement Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Allow users or the system to retry failed operations, such as data fetches or submissions.
### Details:
Add retry buttons to fallback UIs and notifications. Implement automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient errors. Track retry attempts and provide feedback to users.

## 6. Enable Data Recovery and State Restoration [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Provide mechanisms to recover user data or restore application state after an error or crash.
### Details:
Persist critical user input and state locally (e.g., localStorage, IndexedDB). Restore state after reloads or recoverable errors. Offer users options to recover unsaved work.

## 7. Integrate Error Logging and Reporting with Diagnostic Info [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Log errors with detailed diagnostic information and report them to monitoring services for analysis and debugging.
### Details:
Capture error messages, stack traces, component state, and user actions leading up to the error. Integrate with external error tracking services (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket). Ensure sensitive data is not logged. Provide tools for developers to access and analyze error reports.
