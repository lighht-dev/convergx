# Task ID: 16
# Title: Security Dashboard Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the security dashboard with threat monitoring, event logging, and policy management as specified in FR-THR-001 through FR-THR-003.
# Details:
Implement security dashboard with AI-generated threat summaries. Create security event log with detailed filtering. Add threat event visualization and classification. Implement security policy management interface. Create firewall rule configuration component. Add intrusion detection signature management. Implement automated response procedure configuration. Create security export and reporting functionality. Add threat investigation tools and workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Test security dashboard with simulated threat data. Verify event logging and filtering. Test policy management interface. Validate firewall rule configuration. Test intrusion detection signature management. Verify automated response configuration. Test export and reporting functionality. Ensure all security components respect user permissions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Security Dashboard UI Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core UI framework for the security dashboard with clear visual hierarchy and information organization
### Details:
Establish a dashboard layout that places critical security alerts at the top-left, use contrasting colors for different threat levels, and implement consistent typography for various data categories. Follow 2025 dashboard design principles with focus on balancing aesthetics with security functionality.

## 2. Implement Threat Summary Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive threat summary component that provides at-a-glance security status
### Details:
Create visualizations for current threat levels, recent attack vectors, and affected systems. Use color coding to indicate severity levels and ensure the summary automatically updates in real-time with appropriate data refresh rates.

## 3. Build Event Log System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a detailed event logging system with filtering and search capabilities
### Details:
Implement chronological display of security events with severity indicators, timestamp information, and source details. Include advanced filtering options by event type, time range, and affected systems. Ensure proper data masking for sensitive information.

## 4. Develop Threat Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Create interactive data visualizations to represent security threats and patterns
### Details:
Design geographic maps showing attack origins, timeline charts displaying attack frequency, and network diagrams illustrating affected systems. Ensure visualizations are interactive with drill-down capabilities and consistent with the overall dashboard design language.

## 5. Create Policy Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Build an interface for viewing and managing security policies
### Details:
Develop a module for displaying current security policies, compliance status, and policy update capabilities. Include version history, approval workflows, and policy impact analysis features. Implement role-based access controls for policy modifications.

## 6. Implement Firewall Configuration Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.5
### Description: Develop interface for monitoring and configuring firewall settings
### Details:
Create a visual representation of current firewall rules, traffic patterns, and blocked attempts. Include configuration tools with validation checks, rule conflict detection, and change management workflows. Ensure proper authentication for configuration changes.

## 7. Build Intrusion Detection System Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.3
### Description: Create monitoring interface for intrusion detection alerts and configuration
### Details:
Develop real-time alert displays with severity classification, false positive management, and pattern recognition insights. Include configuration options for detection sensitivity and custom rule creation. Implement notification systems for critical intrusions.

## 8. Develop Automated Response Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5, 16.6, 16.7
### Description: Create interface for configuring and monitoring automated security responses
### Details:
Build a system for defining automated response rules, reviewing automated actions taken, and configuring response thresholds. Include simulation capabilities to test response scenarios and effectiveness metrics to evaluate response outcomes.

## 9. Implement Export/Reporting and Investigation Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.7
### Description: Create comprehensive reporting, export capabilities, and investigation toolset
### Details:
Develop customizable report templates, scheduled report generation, and multiple export formats (PDF, CSV, JSON). Include investigation tools with timeline reconstruction, entity relationship mapping, and evidence collection features. Ensure all exports maintain proper security controls and data protection.
