# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React project with TypeScript, configure build tools, and set up the development environment with Docker for the ConvergX network management dashboard.
# Details:
Create a new React 18+ project using Create React App with TypeScript template. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up Docker-based development environment with hot-reloading. Initialize Git repository with proper branching strategy. Configure CI/CD pipeline basics. Install core dependencies including React Router for navigation. Create environment configuration for development, testing, and production environments. Set up mock data services for local development as specified in FR-SYS-004.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Ensure Docker container starts correctly and serves the application. Validate hot-reloading functionality. Confirm ESLint and TypeScript configurations work properly. Test environment variable loading across different configurations.
