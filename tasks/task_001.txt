# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React project with TypeScript, configure build tools, and set up the development environment with Docker for the ConvergX network management dashboard.
# Details:
Create a new React 18+ project using Create React App with TypeScript template. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up Docker-based development environment with hot-reloading. Initialize Git repository with proper branching strategy. Configure CI/CD pipeline basics. Install core dependencies including React Router for navigation. Create environment configuration for development, testing, and production environments. Set up mock data services for local development as specified in FR-SYS-004.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Ensure Docker container starts correctly and serves the application. Validate hot-reloading functionality. Confirm ESLint and TypeScript configurations work properly. Test environment variable loading across different configurations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React Project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template.
### Details:
Run `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` to create the project.

## 2. Configure TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Adjust TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json for optimal project settings.
### Details:
Modify tsconfig.json to include necessary compiler options and paths.

## 3. Set Up ESLint and Prettier [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
### Details:
Install ESLint and Prettier packages, then configure their respective configuration files.

Successfully set up ESLint and Prettier for the project:

âœ… Completed Setup:
- Installed ESLint v9 with Next.js configuration
- Installed Prettier with standard formatting rules
- Created eslint.config.js using the new flat config format
- Created .prettierrc.json with project formatting standards
- Added lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, and type-check scripts to package.json
- Added "type": "module" to package.json for ES module support
- Fixed all formatting issues across the codebase
- Verified TypeScript compilation works correctly

Configuration Details:
- ESLint: Next.js core web vitals + TypeScript recommended + Prettier integration
- Prettier: Single quotes, semicolons, 80 char width, 2 space tabs, LF line endings
- Scripts: Full linting and formatting workflow available via pnpm commands

Remaining Minor Issues:
- 2 TypeScript warnings about 'any' types in app/actions.ts (can be addressed later)
- 2 React warnings about unescaped entities in app/not-found.tsx (can be addressed later)

The core linting and formatting infrastructure is fully functional and ready for development.

## 4. Dockerize the Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the React application.
### Details:
Write a Dockerfile that sets up a Node.js environment and copies project files.
<info added on 2025-05-27T23:51:54.392Z>
Docker configuration has been successfully created for the ConvergX project with the following components:

- Production Dockerfile with multi-stage build using Node.js 20 Alpine
- Updated next.config.ts to enable standalone output for Docker optimization
- docker-compose.yml for production deployment with Redis service
- docker-compose.dev.yml for development with hot reloading support
- Dockerfile.dev optimized for development with volume mounting
- Comprehensive .dockerignore file
- Docker scripts added to package.json

The configuration implements best practices including multi-stage builds, security hardening with non-root user (nextjs:nodejs), network isolation, persistent data storage for Redis, and proper file permissions. Both production and development environments are properly configured with the development setup supporting hot reloading via volume mounting and WATCHPACK_POLLING.

Note that Docker is not currently installed on the system, so testing will require Docker Desktop installation as a next step.

## 5. Initialize Git with Branching Strategy [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up a Git repository with a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow).
### Details:
Initialize a Git repository, set up main and develop branches, and configure Git Flow.

## 6. Configure CI/CD Pipelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
### Details:
Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

## 7. Install Dependencies and Set Environment Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Install necessary dependencies and configure environment variables.
### Details:
Install project dependencies using npm or yarn, and set environment variables in .env files.

## 8. Set Up Mock Data Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.7
### Description: Implement mock data services for testing and development purposes.
### Details:
Use a library like Mock Service Worker to create mock API endpoints for testing.
