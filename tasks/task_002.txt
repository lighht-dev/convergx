# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core UI Framework Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core UI framework with Material-UI components, responsive layouts, and theme configuration according to the design principles outlined in the PRD.
# Details:
Install Material-UI (MUI) library and configure theme provider. Implement light and dark theme modes as specified in FR-SET-001. Create responsive grid system based on 8-pixel grid with breakpoints at 576px, 768px, 992px, and 1200px. Set up color palette with professional blues and grays for primary scheme and status colors (green, yellow, red) for network states. Configure typography using Inter font family for general text and JetBrains Mono for technical data. Implement base layout components including AppBar, Drawer, and main content area. Create reusable UI components for cards, buttons, and form elements following Material Design principles.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive behavior across all specified breakpoints. Verify theme switching functionality between light and dark modes. Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Validate consistent spacing and alignment using the 8-pixel grid system. Test UI components across supported browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).
