# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core UI Framework Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core UI framework with Material-UI components, responsive layouts, and theme configuration according to the design principles outlined in the PRD.
# Details:
Install Material-UI (MUI) library and configure theme provider. Implement light and dark theme modes as specified in FR-SET-001. Create responsive grid system based on 8-pixel grid with breakpoints at 576px, 768px, 992px, and 1200px. Set up color palette with professional blues and grays for primary scheme and status colors (green, yellow, red) for network states. Configure typography using Inter font family for general text and JetBrains Mono for technical data. Implement base layout components including AppBar, Drawer, and main content area. Create reusable UI components for cards, buttons, and form elements following Material Design principles.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive behavior across all specified breakpoints. Verify theme switching functionality between light and dark modes. Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Validate consistent spacing and alignment using the 8-pixel grid system. Test UI components across supported browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Material-UI and Required Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Material-UI in the React project by installing the core library and its dependencies, including emotion and icons.
### Details:
Run npm or yarn commands to install @mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and @mui/icons-material. Verify installation by checking package.json and importing a basic component.

## 2. Configure Theme Provider and Implement Theme Modes [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the ThemeProvider at the root of the application and implement support for light and dark modes.
### Details:
Import createTheme and ThemeProvider from @mui/material/styles. Define theme objects for light and dark modes. Implement a toggle mechanism (e.g., button or context) to switch between modes. Wrap the app in ThemeProvider and pass the selected theme.

## 3. Set Up Color Palette and Typography [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Customize the Material-UI theme with a tailored color palette and typography settings.
### Details:
Extend the theme configuration to define primary, secondary, error, warning, info, and success colors. Configure typography options such as font family, font sizes, and weights. Ensure Roboto font is loaded via Google Fonts in index.html.

## 4. Build Responsive Grid System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement Material-UI's responsive grid system for layout structure.
### Details:
Use Material-UI's Grid component to create a flexible, responsive layout. Define breakpoints and spacing. Test grid behavior across different screen sizes and orientations.

## 5. Create Base Layout Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop foundational layout components such as AppBar, Drawer, Footer, and Container.
### Details:
Build reusable layout components using Material-UI primitives. Ensure components are responsive and integrate with the grid system. Provide slots or props for content injection.

## 6. Develop Reusable UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.5
### Description: Implement a library of reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, dialogs) following Material-UI guidelines.
### Details:
Create custom-styled components using Material-UI's styling system. Ensure components accept props for customization and support theme overrides. Document usage and variations.

## 7. Ensure Accessibility Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and enhance all components and layouts for accessibility, following WCAG and Material-UI best practices.
### Details:
Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation. Test with screen readers and accessibility tools. Address color contrast, focus management, and alt text for icons/images.
