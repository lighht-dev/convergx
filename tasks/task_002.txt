# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core UI Framework Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core UI framework with shadcn/ui components, responsive layouts, and theme configuration according to the design principles outlined in the PRD.
# Details:
Install shadcn/ui library and configure theme provider with Tailwind CSS. Implement light and dark theme modes as specified in FR-SET-001. Create responsive grid system based on 8-pixel grid with Tailwind breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px). Set up color palette with professional blues and grays for primary scheme and status colors (green, yellow, red) for network states. Configure typography using Inter font family for general text and JetBrains Mono for technical data. Implement base layout components including header, sidebar navigation, and main content area. Create reusable UI components for cards, buttons, and form elements using shadcn/ui primitives and Radix UI.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive behavior across all specified breakpoints. Verify theme switching functionality between light and dark modes. Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Validate consistent spacing and alignment using the 8-pixel grid system. Test UI components across supported browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).

Configure typography plugin with Inter font for general text and JetBrains Mono for code/technical data. Set up CSS custom properties for consistent color usage across light and dark themes.

## 4. Build Responsive Grid System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement responsive grid system using Tailwind CSS Grid utilities for layout structure.
### Details:
Create reusable grid components using Tailwind CSS Grid and CSS Grid utilities. Define responsive breakpoints and spacing using Tailwind's responsive prefixes. Test grid behavior across different screen sizes and orientations. Create layout templates for common page structures.

## 5. Create Base Layout Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4

### Details:
Build reusable layout components using shadcn/ui primitives and Radix UI components. Ensure components are responsive and integrate with the Tailwind grid system. Provide slots or props for content injection. Use shadcn/ui Sheet component for sidebar navigation and proper semantic HTML structure.

## 6. Develop Reusable UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.5
### Description: Implement a library of reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, dialogs) using shadcn/ui primitives.
### Details:
Create components using shadcn/ui CLI to generate button, card, dialog, input, and other common components. Customize component styling using Tailwind CSS and CSS variables. Ensure components accept props for variants, sizes, and states. Follow shadcn/ui conventions for component composition and theming.
