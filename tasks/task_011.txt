# Task ID: 11
# Title: Event Timeline Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the event timeline interface with filtering, infinite scroll, and detailed event views as specified in FR-EVT-001 through FR-EVT-007.
# Details:
Implement unified chronological event timeline with visual indicators. Create infinite scroll mechanism with lazy loading for historical events. Implement responsive event grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Add comprehensive filtering system for events by date, severity, device type, etc. Create detailed event view modal or page. Implement event investigation action buttons and workflows. Add device-specific timeline filtering capability. Create event export functionality. Implement real-time event updates in the timeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test event timeline with large datasets. Verify infinite scroll and lazy loading performance. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes. Validate filtering system with multiple criteria. Test detailed event view with all required information. Verify investigation action buttons function correctly. Test device-specific filtering. Ensure real-time updates appear correctly in the timeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Timeline UI Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a clear and visually appealing timeline UI design that effectively displays events in chronological order
### Details:
Focus on creating a vertical timeline layout that clearly shows event progression. Use clear and concise labels, maintain simplicity, and ensure the most important information is prominently displayed. Consider established timeline design conventions to ensure user familiarity.

## 2. Implement Infinite Scroll Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop infinite scroll mechanism to handle large datasets of timeline events
### Details:
Create a system that loads events in batches as the user scrolls, with smooth transitions between loaded content. Implement efficient data fetching to minimize loading times and optimize memory usage. Include scroll position tracking to maintain user context when returning to the timeline.

## 3. Build Responsive Timeline Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Ensure timeline displays properly across all device sizes and orientations
### Details:
Design and implement responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes. Create alternative layouts for mobile devices that maintain usability with touch interactions. Test thoroughly across various devices to ensure consistent user experience regardless of screen size.

## 4. Develop Timeline Filtering System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create comprehensive filtering capabilities for timeline events
### Details:
Implement filters for date ranges, event types, and other relevant attributes. Design an intuitive filter UI that allows users to quickly narrow down timeline events. Include the ability to save and recall filter combinations for repeated use.

## 5. Create Detailed Event View Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Design and implement expanded view for timeline events with comprehensive details
### Details:
Develop a modal or side panel that displays complete event information when a timeline item is selected. Include all relevant metadata, related actions, and navigation between events. Ensure the detailed view maintains context within the overall timeline.

## 6. Implement Investigation Action Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Build system for performing and tracking investigation actions on timeline events
### Details:
Create a framework for defining, executing, and recording investigation actions on events. Include status tracking, user attribution, and action history. Design intuitive UI components for initiating and reviewing investigation activities.

## 7. Develop Device-Specific Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create specialized filtering options optimized for different device types
### Details:
Design touch-friendly filter controls for mobile devices and more detailed options for desktop users. Implement device detection to automatically present the appropriate filtering interface. Ensure filter selections sync across devices for users accessing from multiple platforms.

## 8. Build Timeline Export and Real-time Update System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.4, 11.6
### Description: Implement functionality for exporting timeline data and receiving real-time updates
### Details:
Create export options for timeline data in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.). Implement WebSocket or similar technology for pushing real-time updates to the timeline without requiring page refresh. Include visual indicators for new events and changes to existing events.
