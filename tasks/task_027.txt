# Task ID: 27
# Title: Accessibility Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper ARIA attributes.
# Details:
Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements. Add proper ARIA attributes for custom components. Create focus management for modals and dialogs. Implement color contrast compliance for all text elements. Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content. Create skip navigation links for keyboard users. Implement reduced motion options for animations. Add text alternatives for all non-text content. Create accessible form validation and error messaging. Implement proper heading structure and landmark regions.

# Test Strategy:
Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements. Verify screen reader compatibility using NVDA and VoiceOver. Test color contrast using automated tools. Validate ARIA attributes for custom components. Test focus management in modals and dialogs. Verify skip navigation functionality. Test reduced motion settings. Ensure all non-text content has proper alternatives. Validate form validation accessibility. Test heading structure and landmark regions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible and operable via keyboard alone, including logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
### Details:
Test all navigation flows using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys). Ensure custom widgets are keyboard accessible. Provide visible focus styles for all focusable elements.

## 2. Apply ARIA Attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties to enhance accessibility semantics for assistive technologies.
### Details:
Identify elements needing ARIA roles (e.g., role='button', role='navigation'). Apply ARIA states and properties such as aria-expanded, aria-label, aria-required, and aria-live where necessary. Reference WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for correct usage[1][4][5].

## 3. Manage Focus [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Implement robust focus management to ensure users do not lose context and can navigate efficiently.
### Details:
Set initial focus on page load or after dynamic content changes. Use JavaScript to move focus appropriately after modal dialogs, popups, or navigation events. Prevent focus traps and ensure focus returns to logical locations.

## 4. Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast requirements.
### Details:
Check color contrast ratios for text, icons, and UI components. Adjust foreground/background colors to achieve at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Test with color contrast tools.

## 5. Support Screen Readers [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Test and optimize the site for screen reader compatibility, ensuring all content and controls are announced correctly.
### Details:
Verify that all interactive elements have accessible names and roles. Use ARIA attributes to clarify ambiguous controls. Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

## 6. Implement Skip Navigation Links [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Provide skip links to allow users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to main content.
### Details:
Add a visible 'Skip to main content' link at the top of the page. Ensure it is focusable and works with keyboard navigation. Test with screen readers to confirm it is announced and functional.

## 7. Provide Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all images, icons, and media have appropriate text alternatives for assistive technology users.
### Details:
Add descriptive alt text to images. Use aria-label or aria-labelledby for icons and SVGs. Provide transcripts or captions for audio and video content.
